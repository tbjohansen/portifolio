                        Hello! My name is Thomasi and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
                        My interest in software development started back in 2016 when I decided to try editing custom Blogger themes.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div className={"about-image"}>
                    <img src={P2018} alt={'me'}/>
